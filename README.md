- 👋 Hi, I’m @cdeshazocouchot. I am an engineering undeclared student at the University of Washington - Seattle with an interest in 
     Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus on computer programming and data science.
     
- 👀 My interests are vast; I am currently interested in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Java.
      However I am also interested in data and machine learning languages like SQL and Python in the near future.
      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java fundamentals at the University and HTML/CSS basics.
      I have my assignments in private repositories so as not to give other students potential answers.
      (Available upon request for recruiters who want to see my work). :D

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on websites, game projects, or apps with mutuals that I know in real life. 

- 📫 Need to reach me? LinkedIn is the best way to contact me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/caitlin-deshazo-couchot/

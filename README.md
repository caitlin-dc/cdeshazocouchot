- 👋 Hi, I’m @caitlin-dc. I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering - Machine Learning student at the University of Washington - Seattle. I am tailoring my major toward software and computer programming.

- 👀 I am currently learning Python and Machine Learning principles to work in AI, NLP, Software, or even Aerospace!
      
- 🌱 I’m focusing on learning Python principles through projects and then using Leetcode to sharpen my pre-existing Java skills.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on websites, game projects, or apps with mutuals.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @caitlin-dc. I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering - Embedded Systems student at the University of Washington - Seattle. I am tailoring my major toward software and computer programming.

- 👀 My interests are vast; I am currently interested and learning Java.
      I am very interested in learning how to optimize algorithms, data structures, and run-time.
      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java fundamentals and have taken CSE 142, 143, 331, and 373.
      I have my assignments in private repositories so as not to give other students potential answers.
      (Available upon request).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on websites, game projects, or apps with mutuals that I know in real life.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @cdeshazocouchot. I am an engineering undeclared student at the University of Washington - Seattle with an interest in 
     Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus on computer programming and data science.
     
- 👀 My interests are vast; I am currently interested in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Java.
      However I am also interested in data and machine learning languages like SQL and Python in the near future.
      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java fundamentals at the University and HTML/CSS basics.
      I'll be sharing some of my homework assignments and projects that I've worked on omitting some essential parts that other 
      students may try to use for their own homework (that being said, my assignments aren't perfect examples just yet :D).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on websites, game projects, or apps with mutuals that I know in real life. 

- 📫 Need to reach me? LinkedIn is the best way to contact me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/caitlin-deshazo-couchot/
